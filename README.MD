## Blocipedia - All the stuff you want to know (plus some other stuff you didn't want).

Blocipedia is a CRUD-based wiki application built with Ruby on Rails. It allows users to create and edit their (and others) wiki-style posts!

This project was built by me with the assistance of my mentor at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/).
